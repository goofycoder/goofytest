[TOP] GitHub flow

- Anything in the master branch is deployable

- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)

- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server

- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request

- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master
  Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately

HOWTO: fork (download/copy) a project to your local machine?

https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

Step 1: fork the project
     - Log onto to Github. 
     - Find the project you interested in.
     - Click the "Fork" button

Step 2:
     $git clone https://github.com/<username>/<project_name>
     
 
====================================================================

HOWTO: check in code:
    1. git add <path_to_file>
    (optional) git diff --cached        // see the changes staged to commit
    2. git commit -m "<comments>" 
    3. git push -u original master
        * -u: upstream  
    4. git pull origin master
        * ensure you have absorbed any upstream changes
        * git pull is just a combination of git fetch and git merge.
        
===================================================================

HOWTO: remove the file from repository
     1. git rm <path_to_file>
