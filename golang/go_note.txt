A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.
  - If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; 
  - the variable will take the type of the initializer.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Package:
  - Every Go program is made up of packages.
  - Programs start running in package main.
  - Program is using the packages within the "import (...)"
  - By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. 
      * For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Exported names:
  - After importing a package, you can refer to the names it exports.
  - In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.
  - Exmaple: Foo is an exported name, as is FOO. The name foo is not exported.
