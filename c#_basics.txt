Q: What is the difference between ref & out parameters?  
A: An argument passed to a ref parameter must first be initialized. 
   Compare this to an out parameter,whose argument does not have to be explicitly initialized 
   before being passed to an out parameter.

** Static member
static member types (also referred to as class properties) are used to store data values
which are common to all object instances of class. 

For example, all bank customers would likely earn the same rate of interest on a savings account. 
An interestRate member would, therefore, be declared as static since it is common across 
all object instances of the class.

Static members are declared using the static keyword. For example:
public class BankAccount
{
  public static int interestRate;
}

Q:What is serialization?
A: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. 

Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.

Q: What is Jagged Arrays?
A: A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays. The elements of a jagged array can be of different dimensions and sizes.
   A jagged array is sometimes called an array–of–arrays.

Q: How is method overriding different from method overloading?

A: When overriding a method, you change the behavior of the method for the derived class. Overloading a method simply involves having another method with the same name within the class.

Q:  What are the difference between Structure and Class?
  
A: Structures are value type and Classes are reference type
Structures can not have contractors or destructors.
Classes can have both contractors and destructors.
Structures do not support Inheritance, while Classes support Inheritance.
