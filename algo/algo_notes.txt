Linked List vs Array:

Linked list provides following two advantages over arrays:
1)	Dynamic size
2)	Ease of insertion/deletion

Linked lists have following drawbacks:
1)	Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists.
2)	Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.


------------------------------------------------------------------

A binary tree is threaded by making 
- all right child pointers that would normally be null point to the inorder successor of the node (if it exists)
- all left child pointers that would normally be null point to the inorder predecessor of the node.
