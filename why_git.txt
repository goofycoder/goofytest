Cheap local branching
  *** most compelling feature  
  - Git will allow you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other and the creation
  - easy to tryout new ideas
  - when you push to a remote repository, you do not have to push all of your branches. 
    * You can only share one of your branches and not all of them. 

staging area
  - Unlike the other systems, Git has what it calls the "staging area" or "index". 
  - This is an intermediate area that you can setup what you want your commit to look like before you commit it.

Social coding
  - github

Easy to learn
